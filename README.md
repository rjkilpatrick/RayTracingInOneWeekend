# Ray-Tracing in a Weekend

I have built a Ray-Tracer before in [COSC342](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/cosc342/). This project is based off of the online book [ Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) originally under a [CC0 1.0 Universal license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
